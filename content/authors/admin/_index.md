I am an aspiring data analyst and experienced researcher with a Master of Arts in Economics. Apart from my formal education, I have been self-learning and teaching topics in statistics and research methods. I have several publications in the form of textbooks on <span style="text-decoration:underline">Research Method</span>; <span style="text-decoration:underline">Applied Statistics for Policy Analysis</span>; and <span style="text-decoration:underline">Data Management, Analysis, and Visualization</span> that are freely available to anyone who is interested in this field.

I love data and transforming data into useful information. I started this blog to share data analysis tips and tricks using R and Python and data related topics which i find useful.
