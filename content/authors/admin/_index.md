Hello!<br>
Welcome to my blog.

My name is Fahim. I am an aspiring data analyst and experienced researcher with a Master of Arts in Economics. I love data and transforming data into useful information.

I started this blog to share data analysis tips and tricks using R and Python and data related topics which I find useful.
