<p>I developed this dashboard to visualize the economy &amp; growth related indicators from the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator">World Bank</a> (WB).</p>
<p>It is very simple to use. You select an indicator and it depicts the most recent values of the selected indicator in a map (the first tab of the tabset-panel) and in a treemap (the second tab of the tabset-panel).</p>
<p>It also shows the increase and decrease of the selected indicator over years for a country or a comparison between two or more than two countries.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can download the data in a wide format as well as in a clean and analysis-ready long format.</p>

<p>If you have a working knowledge of R, please use the source code from my GitHub account as I am using the free version of the shinyapps.io which has limited usage.</p>
