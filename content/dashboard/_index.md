## - Compare datasets

The purpose of developing this app is to compare two versions of the same dataset. It takes the data sets in the form of .csv files as input and compares them column by column and row by row and generates the differences, if any. You can then copy the differences or download it as a csv file. Source code: https://github.com/Fahim-Ahmad/compare_df_shiny_app
