<p>Recently I developed <a href="https://github.com/Fahim-Ahmad/r_custom_functions/blob/main/compare_df_function.R"><code>compare_df()</code></a> function in R to compare two datasets.</p>
<p>In response to a friendâ€™s request who is not familiar with R, I created an online R-shiny app that compares two versions of the same data set, row by row and column by column, and generates the differences in a nice and tidy datatable that can be downloaded as a csv file. I make it public so everyone can use and benefit from it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have a working knowledge of R, please use the source code from my github account as I am using free version of the shinyapps.io which has limited usage.</p>
