<p>I developed this dashboard to allow users to explore and compare key social, economic, environmental, and institutional indicators for different countries.</p>
<p>Users can select one or more countries and retrieve the most recent data on these indicators from the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/country">World Bank</a> (WB), which is then displayed in a user-friendly format.</p>
<p>This project was a great learning experience in both Shiny development and web scraping, and I hope it will be useful to others who are interested in this field.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also developed a similar app using Streamlit in Python, which you can access via the source code <a href="https://github.com/Fahim-Ahmad/wb_indicators">here</a> and the app <a href="https://wb-indicators.streamlit.app">here</a>.</p>
