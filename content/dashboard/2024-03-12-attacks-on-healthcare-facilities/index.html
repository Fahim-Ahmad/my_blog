<p>As part of my studies at <a href="https://emergingtalent.mit.edu">MIT Emerging Talent</a>, I participated in a Collaborative Data Science Project where our team undertook a crucial study focused on analyzing the profound impact of attacks on healthcare facilities. Our project delves into the human casualties resulting from these attacks, highlighting the broader implications for global health security and international humanitarian law.</p>
<p>Read more about our work <a href="https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/2024-group-06-cdsp">here</a>.</p>
<p>We have also developed two dashboards: one in Python using Streamlit and another in R using Shiny, allowing access to detailed findings.</p>

<p>If you have a working knowledge of R, please utilize the source code from my GitHub account. I am using the free version of shinyapps.io, which has limited usage.</p>
