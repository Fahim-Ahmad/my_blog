## Required packages:
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr) # for reading .csv file
library(tidyverse); library(data.table) # for data manipulation
library(ggplot2) # for visualization
library(gganimate) # to create animated chart
library(gifski) # to use gifski_renderer
```

## The data:
In this post, I explore how to create an animated bar chart in R to show the top 10 countries with the highest GDP. The data from World Bank is used which is freely accessible from this link [https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD).
Since the data is in comma-separated value (.csv) format, the `read_csv()` function from the **readr** package is used to load the data.

```{r}
# read the data
gdp <- read_csv("data/API_NY.GDP.MKTP.CD_DS2_en_csv_v2_672988.csv", skip = 3)
```

Let's have a look at the data.
```{r}
glimpse(gdp)
```
As we can see the data contains country names, country codes, indicator names, indicator codes, and the GDP from **1960** to **2018**.
At this step, let's delete those columns that will not be used in the analysis, transform the data from wide to long format, drop those rows that contain missing values, and keep only those countries with the highest GDP in each year. To do so, I am using the below codes. These codes are replicable and you can use it for your practice as well.

```{r}
gdp <- gdp %>% 
  select(-c("Indicator Name", "Indicator Code", "2019", "...65")) %>%
  gather(key = "year", value = "gdp", -c("Country Name", "Country Code")) %>%
  filter(!`Country Name` %in% c("World", "Euro area", "European Union", "IBRD only", "IDA & IBRD total", "Japan Late-demographic dividend", "Low & middle income", "Middle income", "OECD members", "Post-demographic dividend", "East Asia & Pacific", "Europe & Central Asia", "Latin America & Caribbean", "Middle East & North Africa", "North America", "South Asia","Sub-Saharan Africa", "Low income", "Lower middle income", "Upper middle income", "High income", "Early-demographic dividend", "East Asia & Pacific (excluding high income)", "East Asia & Pacific (IDA & IBRD countries)", "Europe & Central Asia (excluding high income)", "Europe & Central Asia (IDA & IBRD countries)", "Late-demographic dividend", "Latin America & Caribbean (excluding high income)", "Latin America & the Caribbean (IDA & IBRD countries)", "Arab World", "South Asia (IDA & IBRD)", "IDA total", "Sub-Saharan Africa (excluding high income)", "Sub-Saharan Africa (IDA & IBRD countries)", "IDA blend", "IDA only", "Heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC)")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(gdp), year>1969) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>% arrange(year, - gdp) %>%
  group_by(year) %>% mutate(rank = row_number()) %>% filter(rank <=10) %>%
  mutate(total_gdp = sum(gdp))
```
Let's have a look at the data once again and explore which countries made to the top 10 most of the time.
```{r}
glimpse(gdp)
```

```{r}
gdp %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = gdp, col = toupper(`Country Name`))) + geom_line() + theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(title = toupper("countries with the highest gdp"), subtitle = "From 1970 to 2018", x = NULL, y = toupper("gdp(million $)"))

```

```{r}
summary(gdp$gdp)
```

```{r}
table(gdp$`Country Name`) %>%
  data.table() %>%
  mutate(n = ifelse(N>1, " times", " time")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(toupper(V1), N), y = N, fill = V1)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = F) + theme_bw() + coord_flip() +
  ylim(0, 65) +
  labs(title = toupper("number of times each country made to the top 10"), subtitle = "From 1970 to 2018", x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(N, n)), hjust = -0.5)
```


## Animated Bar Chart Race

At this moment the data is in good shape and can be used for creating an animated bar graph. I am using the `ggplot()` function from the **ggplot2** package for creating bar chart with the explanation for each line of code.

```{r}
plot <- gdp %>%
  # creating bar chart
  ggplot(aes(x = rank, y = gdp, fill = `Country Code`)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = F) +
  # Flip cartesian coordinates
  coord_flip() +
  # sort from highest to the lowest
  scale_x_reverse() +
  # # you can play around this part to change the aesthetic view of the graph
  theme(
    axis.text.y=element_blank(),
    axis.ticks=element_blank(),
    panel.background=element_blank(),
    plot.title=element_text(size=20, hjust=0.5, face="bold", vjust=-1, color = "red"),
    plot.margin = margin(1,1, 1, 1, "cm")
  )
```

Once the bar chart is created, it can be combined with *transition_states*. The *transition_states* from **gganimate** package is used to split the data into multiple parts based on the levels in a given column (here based on each year).

```{r warning=FALSE}
plot <- plot + transition_states(year,
                                 transition_length = 3, # The relative length of the transition
                                 state_length = 1 # The relative length of the pause at each category
                                 ) +
  labs(title = 'Countries with the highest GDP: {closest_state}', x = "", y = "") +      # main title and axis titles
  ylim(0, max(gdp$total_gdp)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(`Country Code`,": ", round(gdp,0)), hjust= -0.5),size = 2.5) # for adding country code and GDP
```

After the animated graph is made, we can use the below codes to save the plot as *GIF*.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
animate(plot,
        nframes = 350, #The number of frames to render (default 100)
        fps = 20, # The framerate of the animation in frames/sec (default 10)
        width = 1200, height = 1000,
        renderer = gifski_renderer("GDP.gif")
        )
```
